  <h1>Why?</h1>
  <p>Who knows? The beginning of this year I decided I wanted to build a harpsichord.
     That morphed into a desire to build a mandolin.
     I was ambivalent about whether or not to use a kit, but found a cheap one in a local music store and bit the bullet.
     That's all I can say. Hopefully I don't mess it up too bad!</p>
  
  <p>Most importantly, why not?</p>
  
    <blockquote><p>As long as ideas are expressed, as long as friction makes bright, as long as vibrating wires make music of harps, we do not want redeemers.<br />

    <blockquote><p>We are instruments endowed with sentience and memory. Our senses are like keys plucked by the environment which surrounds us, and that often pluck themselves; and there, in my judgment, you have everything that takes place in a harpsichord constructed like you and me.<br />
