I just took a deep breath, spread glue around the rims of the back and top of my ‘mandolin’ and wrapped a dismembered innertube around the edge, and threw on some clamps for good measure. Fingers crossed that all will dry tolerably.

We can only hope it goes well.

5 minutes later I realize I probably should've cropped the extra space around the button at the base of the neck joint before gluing it—I at least can't think of a good clean way to get it off after it's glued without thoroughly marring the sides of the neck. But I'll have to figure something out, and it'll definitely be exciting to see this damn thing in one piece.

Hopefully it stays that way!
