So, I finally managed to get the binding on. Hint: it involved a glue other than Duco plastic model cement. If you have any choice, get the stuff in the *green* tube. The local hardware store only had the blue stuff, and it doesn't work too great. I ended up getting some CA (superglue) from a hobby store that was on my way to "Homestead":http://www.homesteadpickinparlor.com/ the other night, and did it then.

It's not quite perfect. There are a few gaps, mostly on the side where for some reason the binding didn't sit all the way down in its channel. I'll have to do a bit better next time. But it looks decent, there aren't any enormous defects.

I was out of town all weekend visiting my sister in Iowa, so that's why it's been so long since I've done much work or thrown down a new post. I'd meant to swing by a liquor store and get some Everclear, I saw some kids partaking of the beverage orally and that sparked my memory (I'd be using it to dissolve shellac flakes of course), but then the next day I completely forgot. It was a sunday, and liquor stores were probably closed for religious purposes or something anyway. I'm not at all sure how those liquor laws work.

But other than my relative success at gluing the binding I've whittled a bit at the tone bars:

And practice-cut approximate mocks of my peghead conception:

It turns out coping saws are much easier to deal with when you the teeth face towards the handle and you can pull the saw towards you to make your cut instead of having to push it away from you. Who knew? It'll take a bit more before I'm mentally prepared to saw into the actual peghead (or is it headstock? what's the proper term?). In due time.

Other than that, the neck is getting pretty darn close to fitting:

I'm a bit wary of trying too hard to fit the joint any better. I'm going to try rough fitting the joing and then pounding it with a mallet. If I can force the neck the fractional distance it'll take to sit it flush with the bottom of the headblock than I'll be all set for dripping some glue on it, tapping it all the way in, clamping and drying it. But I've definitely gotta cut the peghead shape in first.

And when I dry fit the neck, it's actually starting to look like a mandolin!

Hopefully it ends up sounding like oneâ€¦
