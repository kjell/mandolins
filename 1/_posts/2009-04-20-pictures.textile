Other than that I got the tone bars fitted and ready to glue, messed with my scraper and neck shape/smoothness a little bit, and got the neck fitting into it's dovetail just about perfectly. That's been a bear. the fingerboard extension is too thick, and keeps the neck from seating all the way down into the joint, and so I've slowly been scraping away at the stuff and I've finally got it just about there. I think that if I gave the joint some glue and tapped it in nice and hard with a mallet that'd drive it all the way in, and I'll probably give it a bit more scraping tomorrow.

Other than my so–far–insurmountable fear of actually gluing anything together, things are coming along nicely. Hopefully tomorrow I'll be able to get over that tomorrow: I'm planning on stopping by the hardware store and finding some Duco cement to glue the binding onto the top, give that a bit to set and then glue the tone bars in and let all that glue dry for a while.

I'm all excited to glue the neck in, but tonight I realized I need to figure out how to saw my chosen shape into the peghead. That'll be a test. So far this whole project has worked out fairly well, but I'll I've been doing is scraping, sanding and cutting a little bit. Gluing and sawing are virgin territory. We'll see how that goes.

I've turned my desk into a 'workbench,' leaving only…

…one place to set my computer. But really I spend enough time sitting at it during work hours, I could stand to be on it less at night.
