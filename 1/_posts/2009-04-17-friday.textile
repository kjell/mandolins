I got a copy of the plan from Siminoff that shows the cross section of the air chamber, with top and back graduations at different points. Glued those onto card stock and cut them out to have a reference for my archings, at which point I realized they were more or less useless because I'd but them out in one piece, so that I could fit them into the curvatures of top and back, but I realized that they're opposite, and not particularly useful. I'm going to try and figure out a caliper to check the thicknesses, but worst case it wouldn't be that hard to recut the templates I already have and get a good estimate.

I decided to try out a bowl–carving chisel I got from my mom on the back. Used it a bit on the inside with no adverse results, but it seemed like it'd take an inordinate amount of time to take wood out evenly from the whole inside with that. Unfortunately for whatever reason I then decided to pull some wood off the outside of the back with the chisel, and got a bit overzealous and now I have a few good gouges just below the glue joint towards where the tailpiece goes. It'll be work to sand these out, but that's what I get I suppose.
