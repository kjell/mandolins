title: Binding Fail!
---

I'm still doing battle with the binding. I gave up on what I had, some of it ‘stuck’ and some still wouldn't after I tried again, this time with masking tape and rubber bands. I peeled it all off—expending less energy than it takes me to peel a banana, which can't be a good sign. I think my next course of action is to rough up the inside of the binding with sandpaper and hope that then the glue will work. Probably should have thought of that before struggling so in the first place. If that doesn't work Duco cement will be dead to me.

I'm also going to do it in the basement where (a) I won't be fumigating myself (I'm doing this in my room for some odd reason, and I sleep 10 feet away from where I'm doing the glue) (b) it's maybe just less humid, which I think might(?) make a difference as the glue dries.

But I'm sure that my imaginary audience must be immeasurably disappointed, so I'm here to placate you with some photography. I'll be down visiting my sister at Grinnell this weekend, so I'm gonna give the gluing another shot tonight and cross my fingers that after a couple of days I can move on to whatever the next step is: carving the tone bars/however much I decide to tune the soundboard, getting the headstock cut out, and then hopefully sometime -gluing- +attaching+ the neck (I don't want anything to have to do with glue right now).

<p>I'm a bit worried about this part. The way the top assembly came the binding channel right here was fucked up, so I had to go and deepen it with a chisel. But because of that, the sides don't sit flush with the binding, I'll have to whittle the sides down, but it makes me nervous. Also where the sides join doesn't work too hot.</p>

<p>I cut ou a practice headstock. What it should look like is a few pictures up. My coping saw skills need a bit of work.</p>
