title: Tone bars
---

Just roughed in the tone bars. Used tonebar-shaped strips of sand paper taped to the soundboard under where the bars will go and whittled away until they had a good fit. The first one wasn't too hard—and nether was the second, at least until I though I was done and took up the paper and checked for a final fit and it was somehow way off. Must not have been paying much attention there.

Earlier today I took my best shot at fixing up the binding channel problem I bitched about in the last entry. Used a chisel to bring the channel back to flush with the top and did a fairly uniform job, and glued two shims made out of thinned popsicle sticks into the gap between rim and headblock. It looks fine now, and hopefully it'll continue to do so up when I have to sand the sides back to the binding.

I'm ambivalent to glue the tone bars on, not wanting to screw anything up too bad, so I'm gonna hold off on that for tonight. Also the way the kit said to measure them out and place them (at least my interpretation thereof) is different from what Siminoff's plans say—which I suppose makes sense them being completely different soundboards and all—but it gives me pause. 

I just used audacity to 'tap tune' both plates. I was just checking the notes, but I figure one of the great things about computers is that I can take those sound samples and save them to come back and look at any time I want at any point in the future, barring catastrophic data loss. That's part of why I want to keep good records here. If I get through this and keep going with the hobby (and I hope to!) it'll be good to have the references.

Speaking of which, I need to start snapping some photos. Unfortunately my camera charger is in Florida. But I'll find someone's to borrow and get some tomorrow hopefully.
